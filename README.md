# Air Sensor Evaluation Library

A Python library for evaluating the performance of air sensors for use in
ambient, outdoor, fixed site, non-regulatory supplemental and informational
monitoring applications.

In February 2021, EPA released two reports detailing recommended
performance testing protocols, metrics, and target values for
the evaluation of sensors measuring either fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)
or ozone (O<sub>3</sub>).

This library provides modules for testing air sensors measuring PM<sub>2.5</sub>
and O<sub>3</sub> against FRM/FEM reference measurements including calculation
of performance metrics and comparison against target ranges recommended by EPA.
