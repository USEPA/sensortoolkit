AirSensor Instantiation
=======================
The first object the user encounters is the AirSensor object. This structure is
used to keep track of sensor attributes and can be used to import and access
sensor datasets. First, users create an instance of the AirSensor object type,
specifying the make and model of the sensor. Below is an example of instantiating the
AirSensor object within the `example.py` script for the example sensor dataset included
alongside the sensortoolkit library:

.. code-block:: python

  sensor_object = sensortoolkit.AirSensor(make='Example_Make',
                                          model='Model',
                                          project_path=work_path)

.. list-table:: ``sensortoolkit.AirSensor() attributes``
 :widths: 50 75
 :header-rows: 1

 * - Attribute name
   - Description
 * - ``make``
   - The name of the manufacturer for the sensor. Users are recommended to |br|
     replace spaces with underscores.
 * - ``model``
   - The name of the sensor model. Users are recommended to replace spaces with |br|
     underscores.
 * - ``project_path``
   - The path to the directory where the user intends to store data, figures, |br|
     and reports relating to the sensor being testing.

Constructing the sensortoolkit Directory Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
sensortoolkit utilizes a folder structure for storing datasets and organizing
related files. This folder structure is located at the path to a directory the
user wishes to store evaluation-related content in. This path is referred to as
the `project path` and is the same path the user passes to ``project_path`` when
creating an instance of the ``sensortoolkit.AirSensor`` object. Sensor and
reference datasets as well as supplementary statistics are stored in a ``/data``
folder. Figures created by the library are stored in a ``/figures`` folder.
Testing reports are saved within a ``/reports`` folder. Users should run the
following line of code to construct this folder structure at the user’s
``project_path``:

.. code-block:: python

  sensor_object.create_directories()

.. note::
  The above code snippet assumes that the user named their instance of the ``sensortoolkit.AirSensor``
  object ``sensor_object``. If a different name was chosen, replace instances of ``sensor_object`` with ``[custom_name]``
  to access the instance attributes such as the ``create_directories()`` method.

Users should see the following printed to the console indicating the constructed directory structure:

.. code-block:: console

  Creating "data" subdirectory within C:\Users\...\Documents\my_evaluation
  ..\data\eval_stats
  ..\data\reference_data

Directory Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Below is the directory structure created by running the ``sensor_object.create_directories()``
function for the ``Example_Make_Model`` sensor type.

.. code-block:: console

  my_evaluation                           <-- Top level directory. Set as ``work_path``.
  ├───data                                <-- Sensor and reference data, statistics, setup configuration files, etc.
  │   ├───eval_stats
  │   │   └───Example_Make_Model
  │   ├───reference_data                  <-- Subdirectories organized by reference data source.
  │   │   ├───airnow
