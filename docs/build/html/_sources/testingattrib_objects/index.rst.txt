Testing Attribute Objects
=========================
sensortoolkit contains several class objects to aid users in various data
analysis tasks. **These objects can be roughly divided into two categories:
testing attribute objects and evaluation objects.**

Since users may wish to evaluate multiple sensor types and numerous pollutants,
the intent in organizing the evaluation workflow into a set of recognizable and
consistent class objects is to provide an easy-to-navigate platform for conducting
evaluations and data analysis, while also allowing a high degree of customization.

-------

Testing attribute objects include the
``sensortoolkit.AirSensor`` object, ``sensortoolkit.ReferenceMonitor`` object,
and the ``sensortoolkit.Parameter`` object. These objects are used to house
information about the air sensor being tested (``sensortoolkit.AirSensor``), the
FRM/FEM monitor against which sensor measurements are being evaluated
(``sensortoolkit.ReferenceMonitor``), and the parameter or pollutant corresponding
to the measurement data of interest for the evaluation (``sensortoolkit.Parameter``).
In addition, both the ``sensortoolkit.AirSensor`` and ``sensortoolkit.ReferenceMonitor``
objects house sensor and reference data, respectively.

.. note::

  sensortoolkit organizes datasets and various outputs, such as figures,
  evaluation datasets, and reports into several sub-directories within a project folder
  that user specifies.

  The following guide assumes that the user intends to place all user-created scripts,
  datasets, figures, and reports at a project folder location ``C:/Users/.../Documents/my_evaluation``. While we name this
  folder ``my_evaluation``, users are free to assign their project directory whatever name suits best.

From within the project directory, create a new python file and import the sensortoolkit library.
Create a variable for indicating the project folder path (below, named ``work_path``). This should also be the full directory
path for the parent directory of the script. Data, figures, and reports will be stored in this
directory location, so users may wish to create a new or empty folder for evaluations.

.. code-block:: python

  # This python script is located at "../my_evaluation/evaluation.py"
  import sensortoolkit

  # Point to the full directory path for this scripts' parent directory
  # This is the project folder path
  work_path = ('C:/Users/.../Documents/my_evaluation')
