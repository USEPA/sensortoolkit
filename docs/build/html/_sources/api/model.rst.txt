``sensortoolkit.model``
-----------------------

The ``sensortoolkit.model`` subpackage contains modules for applying or creating
correction methods for sensor data. Methods include the U.S.-Wide Correction
Equation developed by Barkjohn et al. 2021 [#f1]_ for the PurpleAir PA-II and modules for
calculating or applying a general linear correction equation based on the ordinary
least-squares regression between sensor (dependent variable) and reference
(independent variable) measurements.

Clicking on each module below will open a page with a detailed description and
list of functions included within the module.
