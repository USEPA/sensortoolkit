===================================
Importing the sensortoolkit Library
===================================

To create scripts that utilize the `sensortoolkit` library, itâ€™s recommended
that users develop their code in the integrated development environment (IDE).
Anaconda comes with the Spyder IDE, which can be accessed via the Anaconda
Prompt with the following command:

::

  (sensor-eval) $ spyder

.. note::

    A reminder that `conda` users should be actively working in the ``sensor-eval``
    environment.

Users are recommended to save custom scripts that use the `sensortoolkit` library
in the ``User_Scripts`` folder within the main library directory:

.. parsed-literal::

    +---Data and Figures
    +---docs
    +---Documentation
    +---Example_Scripts
    +---Reports
    +---sensortoolkit
    +---User_Scripts


In order to load modules in the `sensortoolkit` library, the python interpreter
needs to know the directory path where the library is located. To use the library
in a new file, user's should add the following lines of code (copy and paste).

.. note::

  The following code block defines ``lib_path`` relative to the current directory (highlighted line),
  and assumes the file is located in either the User_Scripts folder or a parallel
  directory. If users wish to place their files elsewhere, the path for the
  library should be set by the absolute path to the main library directory.

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    import os
    import sys
    lib_path = os.path.abspath(__file__ + '../../..')
    if lib_path not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append(lib_path)
    import sensortoolkit
    from sensortoolkit.sensor_eval import SensorEvaluation

.. important::

    The code above adds the library path to ``sys.path``, which is a listing of
    directories the python interpreter looks through at run time for loading
    required packages. **The code above MUST be included in files in which users
    intend to use sensortoolkit.**
