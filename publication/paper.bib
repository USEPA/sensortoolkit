   url = {https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIR.0b013e3181dbece1 %X In 2004, the first American Heart Association scientific statement on “Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease” concluded that exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM &lt;2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease–related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM2.5 exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published. Finally, PM2.5 exposure is deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.},

   url = {https://www.essoar.org/doi/abs/10.1002/essoar.10500022.1 %X Low-cost particulate sensors can allow for establishing a dense monitoring network to increase the spatial resolution of air quality information, which is particularly of interest in urban areas. However, these sensors are often affected by environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, the effects of which must be accounted for so that the accuracy of these sensors in field conditions can be quantified. In this paper, we conduct long-term tests of two types of low-cost particulate sensors: Met-One NPM and PurpleAir units. We assess the self-consistency of larger groups (12 to 25) of sensors, develop empirical equations for correcting the measurements of these sensors to better match those of regulatory-grade instruments, and assess the long-term performance of these sensors during deployments lasting over a year. These assessments are used to assess sensor performance in two different use cases: improving community awareness of air quality with a focus on short-term qualitative indications and providing accurate long-term quantitative information for health impact studies. We find that, for the short-term case, using either quadratic or piecewise-linear correction equations, either sensor can be used to provide reasonably accurate concentration information for PM2.5 (mean absolute error on the order of 4 µg/m3) in near-real time. For the long-term case, by applying in-field noise-adjustment, bias can be reduced below 1 µg/m3. These results indicate the suitability of these sensors for supplementing regulatory-grade instruments in sparsely monitored regions, as well as for conducting hotspot mapping to better understand the variability of air quality in urban areas.},
