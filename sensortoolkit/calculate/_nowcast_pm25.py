This module calculates U.S.EPA's NowCast for fine particulate matter
(:math:`PM_{2.5}`) for data recorded or averaged to 1-hour measurement
intervals.

For reporting changes in air quality at high time-resolution, U.S.
EPAâ€™s NowCast calculates hourly :math:`PM_{2.5}` concentration values via a
12-hour window of hourly :math:`PM_{2.5}` measurements. Values are weighted
based on the range of concentration levels observed within the 12-hour window,
whereby large changes result in greater weighting of recent hours while steady
air conditions result in more evenly distributed weighting of hourly
concentrations.

Module Dependencies
-------------------
* Python (version >= 3.7):
    Programming language. Module tested with Python versions 3.7 and
    version 3.8.
* NumPy (version >= 1.16.5):
    Mathematical operations library. Module tested with versions 1.16.5
    through 1.20.1.
* Pandas (version >= 0.25.1):
    Data analysis library. Module tested with versions 0.25.1 through
    1.2.4.


Calculation
-----------

The NowCast for a selected (current) hour is computed via the following steps:

    1. Select a 12-hour window of PM measurements whereby the oldest hour in the
       selection is 11 hours preceding the current hour. The most recent
       (current) hour is the hour for which the NowCast will be computed. **At
       least two of the last three hours (including the current hour) must have
       concentration values to compute the NowCast.**

    2. From this 12-hour window, select the maximum and minimum PM
       concentrations present. Compute the range by subtracting the minimum from
       the maximum.

    3. Normalize the range by dividing by the maximum concentration value. This
       gives a measure of the rate of change of PM values within the 12-hour
       window.

    4. Compute the weight factor by subtracting the normalized rate of change
       from 1.

    5. If the weight factor is less than 0.5, round the value up to 0.5. The
       weight factor must fall within the range 0.5 to 1.0.

    6. Multiply each hour in the 12-hour window by the weight factor raised to
       the power of the number of hours ago that the value was recorded. The
       most recent (current) hour in the series is raised to the zeroth power
       and the oldest hour is raised to the 11th power.

    7. Sum the weighted PM values computed in the previous step for each hour
       in the 12-hour window.

    8. In a similar method to steps 6 and 7, compute the sum of the weight
       factor raised to the 0th through 11th power. This sum includes 12 terms,
       whereby the power of each term corresponds to the number of hours ago
       that a concentration value was recoded.

    9. Divide the weighted concentration sum calculated in step 7 by the sum
       determined in step 8. The result is the NowCast for the zeroth (current)
       hour in the 12-hour window.
