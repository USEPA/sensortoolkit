This module contains a method for averaging the dual PMS5003 PM2.5 data channels
for PurpleAir PA-II and PA-II-SD sensors. This method of data averaging was
developed by Barkjohn et al. 2021 [#f1]_, and is discussed in detail in the
publication section 3.2.3 "Comparison of A and B channels". Briefly, quality
control (QC) criteria are applied during data averaging, whereby the absolute
and percent difference between concurrent (nearest neighbor by logged timestamp)
A and B channel measurement pairs are calculated. If both of these QC criteria
do not exceed respective thesholds, the A and B channels are averaged. Otherwise,
occasions where the A and B channel differ by a margin greater than the QC
criteria thresholds are set null.
